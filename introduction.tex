% \subsection*{Limitation of Current CaaS Server Consolidation}
% We identify the limitation of state-of-the-art server consolidation approaches 
% in terms of two phases \cite{Varasteh:2015fu} and computing system design.
% Phase 1 - Problem definition including objective functions and constraints; 
% Phase 2 - The techniques to solve the optimization problems. 
% From the computing system design point of view, we identify a cross-layer collaborative 
% technique and a VM multiplexing technique which can potentially improve the utilization of 
% computation resources.

% \subsubsection*{Limitation in the IaaS model}
% Infrastructure as a Service is one of the three basic 
% service models (others are SaaS and PaaS) in Cloud computing. Different from other two service 
% models, IaaS allows Cloud customers to manage the low-level details of 
% virtual machine sizes, security settings and network regions. 
% From the perspective of resource management, IaaS separates 
% the concern of customers' task allocation and VM placement.
% Cloud customers or brokers estimate the computational resources they need and map them into
% a set of virtual machines. Once the task allocation is done, 
% Cloud resource management system will find a set of servers and provision the required VM
% on them. 

% However, this separated responsibility has become of a major reason for the low utilization in Cloud
% data centers. Cloud customers and brokers tend to over-estimate the resource they need in order
% to maintain its QoS in the peak service time. In fact, the peak time only accounts for a small portion
% of the overall service period. 
% Although modern virtualization technology allows overbooking strategies, Cloud providers also
% need to keep monitoring the overbooked servers to avoid overload. This surely increases the 
% overhead of management.

% One of the approach to improve the resource utilization is to put 
% the responsibility of task allocation and VM consolidation in the same hand of Cloud providers,
% thereafter, Cloud provider can estimate and dynamically adjust the resource assigned to a task.
% In addition, VM multiplexing can also be used in improving the utilization.
% Mann's research \cite{} gives an example which shows a scenario that simultaneously decide the 
% task allocation and VM placement can reduce one third of the energy consumption.

% \begin{figure}

% 	\caption{An example shows VM multiplexing can reduce 33\% of energy consumption \cite{}}
% 	\label{fig:example}
% \end{figure}

% Another limitation of IaaS model is that it only provides limited types of VM with fixed amount resources (including CPU, memory, etc). When a customer chooses VM type, they are forced to
% choose a VM type with the enough resource of a critical resource (e.g. CPU), therefore, other resources are over-provisioned \cite{Gmach:2012uu}. In order to tackle the fixed size of resources,
% previous researchers employ an overbooking technique \cite{Tomas:2013us}, where extra
% VM can be placed in a PM dependent on the actual resource utilization in that PM instead of the VM sizes.

% As shown above, service allocation has strong influence on VM placement.
% Therefore, instead of considering of complicated algorithms to achieve server consolidation.
% We can think from system design point of view to build a cross-layer (SaaS and IaaS) 
% collaborative technique which leads to high utilization as well as energy saving. 

% Another benefit brought from this technique is that, it will further releases the burden from 
% server providers of estimating the resource requirement and resource selection. 
% The price model will follow the pay-as-you-go policy so that service providers do not need to 
% rent a certain amount of reserved resources to cover the minimum requirement.


% % \subsubsection*{Affinity aware VM Placement}
% \subsubsection*{VM Multiplexing}

% Another direction that could potentially improve the utilization of resource is VM multiplexing.
% VM multiplexing is a technique that several services are deployed into a same VM so that 
% it improve the utilization of saving a little amount of resource from running a separated VM.

% VM multiplexing is a technique that usually be conducted by a private cloud owner, because 
% private cloud owner has complete control of cloud resources and tasks, multiple tasks 
% can be consolidated in one VM. Previously, VM multiplexing is not suitable for a public cloud
% environment because the operating system cannot offer a performance isolation among the 
% applications running internally.

% With the prevalence of container technology (e.g Docker \cite{}), public cloud providers can
% offer isolated virtual environments with shared operating system 
% which is in essence VM multiplexing. 
% Containers can increase the efficiency of cloud resource 
% utilization because it is much light weighted than a VM which means it requires 
% much less resource to than a VM manager.  Additionally, containers share a single operating system,
% which offers much fast inter-container communication via system standard calls than inter-VM
% communication techniques.

% Current research mostly concentrate on VM consolidation problem. However, when the

% \section*{Research Goal}
% The overall goal of this thesis is to propose a server consolidation approach that
% considers the challenges from all six points mentioned 
% above when generating solutions.

% \emph{The third aspect} The dynamic 
% \textcolor{Maroon}{Brief Literature Review}

% In the previous decade, 
% Cloud providers who were focusing on ensuring quality of service, 
% has quickly expanded their infrastructures into a large scale.
% As a result, the average utilization of servers is as low as 20\%, 
% according to \cite{energy_2007}'s observation of google's datacenter, hence, the energy was largely wasted. 

% Despite the energy consumption by none information and communication technologies (ICT) equipments
% such as cooling and airing systems, 
% the energy can be derived from two aspects, first, the hardwares of servers contribute a static consumption. 
% Second, the usage of computing, storage and network resources cause a dynamic consumption. 
% Therefore, improving the efficiency of resources are also two folds, minimizing the static part and 
% delievering more performance proportional to the dynamic workload.

% These are the inituition behind server consolidation. Server consolidation improves the utilization of resources by 
% concentrates workloads in a few servers so that others can be turned off or put into sleep to save energy. 
% Therefore, it achieves reduction of static energy consumption as well as improving the utilization of resources. 
% The consolidation can be done with the help of virtual machine (VM), 
% which can be easily transport from one physical machine (PM) to another. 
% However, as the scale of reallocation of VMs become large and various quality of services (QoS) requirements have to
% be considered, an efficient automatic approach is an urgent and necessary need.
