\small
A container-based cloud is a new trend in Cloud computing that introduces more granular management of applications and reduces overheads of virtual machine (VM).  Compared with VM-based clouds, container-based clouds can further improve the energy efficiency with a finer granularity server consolidation in data centers. Current VM-based single level of server consolidation cannot be used in container-based clouds because container-based clouds have two levels of placement: container to VM and VM to Physical machine. Existing research lacks energy model and optimization algorithms that consider the joint allocation of container and VM. 
This work aims to improve energy efficiency in container-based cloud by proposing two bilevel energy models and three Evolutionary Computation (EC)-based optimization algorithms for three placement decision scenarios: initial placement of applications, periodic placement of applications, and dynamic placement of applications. The two novel bilevel energy models and three EC algorithms will contribute to better management of resources for energy efficiency in container-based clouds.

% In recent years, virtualization technology has evolved to allow finer granularity resource management.
% A recent development of Container technique \cite{Soltesz:2007cu} has driven the attention of both industrial and academia.
% Container is an operating system level of virtualization which means multiple containers can be installed in a same operating system (see Figure \ref{fig:comparison} right-hand side). Each container provides an isolated environment for an application. In short, a VM is partitioned into smaller manageable units.}
