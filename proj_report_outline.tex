\begin{abstract}
Container-based Cloud is new trend in Cloud computing which utilizes the container technology to achieve a fine granularity of resource management. However, energy-efficiency in container-based Cloud is low because the traditional server consolidation strategy of Virtual machine (VM)-based Cloud cannot be directly used in container-based Cloud. This is because the structure of placement has been change from a single level: VM-physical machine (PM) to bilevel: container-VM and VM-PM. This work aims at reducing energy consumption by proposing a new bilevel optimization model to the container-based server consolidation problem on three placement decision scenarios: application initial placement, periodic optimization, and dynamic placement. This work will propose EC-based algorithms to solve the all three placement decision scenarios. The proposed approaches are expected to optimize the energy consumption in the single objective application initial placement, multi-objective periodic optimization with considering various types of workload, and automatically generated dispatching rules for fast placement in dynamic placement problem.

% In recent years, virtualization technology has evolved to allow finer granularity resource management.
% A recent development of Container technique \cite{Soltesz:2007cu} has driven the attention of both industrial and academia.
% Container is an operating system level of virtualization which means multiple containers can be installed in a same operating system (see Figure \ref{fig:comparison} right-hand side). Each container provides an isolated environment for an application. In short, a VM is partitioned into smaller manageable units.}
