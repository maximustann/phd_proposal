abstract = {Cloud computing has emerged as an exciting hosting paradigm to drive up server utilization and reduce data center operational costs. Even though clouds present a single unified homogeneous resource pool view to end users, the underlying server landscape may differ in terms of functionality and reconfiguration capabilities (e.g., support for shared processors, live migration). In a private cloud setting where information on the resources as well as workloads are available, the placement of applications on clouds can leverage it to achieve better consolidation with performance guarantees. In this work, we present the design and implementation of CloudMap, a provisioning system for private clouds. Given an application's resource usage patterns, we match it with a server cluster with the appropriate level of reconfiguration capability. In this cluster, we place the application on a server that has existing workloads with complementary resource usage profile. CloudMap is implemented using a hybrid architecture with a global server cluster selection module and local cluster-specific server selection modules. Using production traces from live data centers, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CloudMap over existing placement methodologies.},

abstract = {The rapid growth in demand for computational power driven by modern service applications combined with the shift to the Cloud computing model have led to the establishment of large-scale virtualized data centers. Such data centers consume enormous amounts of electrical energy resulting in high operating costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Dynamic consolidation of virtual machines (VMs) using live migration and switching idle nodes to the sleep mode allows Cloud providers to optimize resource usage and reduce energy consumption. However, the obligation of providing high quality of service to customers leads to the necessity in dealing with the energy-performance trade-off, as aggressive consolidation may lead to performance degradation. Because of the variability of workloads experienced by modern applications, the VM placement should be optimized continuously in an online manner. To understand the implications of the online nature of the problem, we conduct a competitive analysis and prove competitive ratios of optimal online deterministic algorithms for the single VM migration and dynamic VM consolidation problems. Furthermore, we propose novel adaptive heuristics for dynamic consolidation of VMs based on an analysis of historical data from the resource usage by VMs. The proposed algorithms significantly reduce energy consumption, while ensuring a high level of adherence to the service level agreement. We validate the high efficiency of the proposed algorithms by extensive simulations using real-world workload traces from more than a thousand PlanetLab VMs. Copyright 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The more large-scale data centers infrastructure costs increase, the
more simulation-based evaluations are needed to understand better the
trade-off between energy and performance and support the development of
new energy-aware resource allocation policies. Specifically, in the
cloud computing field, various simulators are able to predict and
measure the behavior of applications on different architectures using
different resource allocation policies. Yet, only a few of them have the
ability to simulate energy-saving strategies, and none of them support
the complete advanced configuration and power interface (ACPI)
specification. ACPI defines a terminology for all possible power states
of a machine and their associated power rate. The hardware industry has
relied on ACPI to provide up-to-date standard interfaces for hardware
discovery, configuration, power management, and monitoring, enabling a
better understanding of the energy consumption level of different
hardware states, referred to as ACPI G-states, S-states, and P-states.
In this paper, we improve the modeling and simulation of the ACPI
G/S-states and show not only that these states offer different
energy-saving levels but also that state transitions consume energy. In
addition, we model the latency to transit between two states and the
effects on the turnaround time when the transitions are not performed
conservatively. Furthermore, the equations provide essential information
to quantify the trade-off between energy consumption and performance and
assist in the analysis/decision on which strategy fits better in the
environment and how it could be refined. Our expanded energy model was
implemented in CloudSim and validated with simulation-based experiments
with a very high level of accuracy, with a standard deviation of at most
6{\%}. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {There is growing incentive to reduce the power consumed by large-scale data centers that host online services such as banking, retail commerce, and gaming. Virtualization is a promising approach to consolidating multiple online services onto a smaller number of computing resources. A virtualized server environment allows computing resources to be shared among multiple performance-isolated platforms called virtual machines. By dynamically provisioning virtual machines, consolidating the workload, and turning servers on and off as needed, data center operators can maintain the desired quality-of-service (QoS) while achieving higher server utilization and energy efficiency. We implement and validate a dynamic resource provisioning framework for virtualized server environments wherein the provisioning problem is posed as one of sequential optimization under uncertainty and solved using a lookahead control scheme. The proposed approach accounts for the switching costs incurred while provisioning virtual machines and explicitly encodes the corresponding risk in the optimization problem. Experiments using the Trade6 enterprise application show that a server cluster managed by the controller conserves, on average, 26{\%} of the power required by a system without dynamic control while still maintaining QoS goals.},

In this context, most of the existing solutions rely on aggressive virtual machine migration, thus resulting in unnecessary overhead and energy wastage. This article presents a virtual machine consolidation algorithm with usage prediction (VMCUP) for improving the energy efficiency of cloud data centers. Our algorithm is executed during the virtual machine consolidation process to estimate the short-term future CPU utilization based on the local history of the considered servers. The joint use of current and predicted CPU utilization metrics allows a reliable characterization of overloaded and underloaded servers, thereby reducing both the load and the power consumption after consolidation. We evaluate our proposed solution through simulations on real workloads from the PlanetLab and the Google Cluster Data datasets. In comparison with the state of the art, the obtained results show that consolidation with usage prediction reduces the total migrations and the power consumption of the servers while complying with the service level agreement.},

There are a number of different algorithms developed based on classical optimisation methods to solve different classes of the BLP problems where the search space is known. There also exist a number of problems in the BLP which current algorithms are not sufficiently robust to solve. In this paper, a bi-level genetic algorithm (BiGA) is proposed to solve different classes of the BLP problems within a single framework.

The results suggest that BiGA algorithm is robust to solve different classes of the BLP problems and demonstrates potential for real life problems.},

In this paper, we suggest a nondominated sorting-based multiobjective EA (MOEA), called nondominated sorting genetic algorithm Il (NSGA-II). which alleviates all the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast nondominated sorting approach with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best (with respect to fitness and spread) N solutions. Simulation results on difficult test problems show that the proposed NSGA-II, in most problems, is able to find much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to Pareto-archived evolution strategy and strength-Pareto EA-two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multiobjective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained muItiobjective optimizer and much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.},

Design/methodology/approach â Adoption of the ideals of SoTL is considered an important approachforsalvaging the higher educationlandscapearoundtheworldthat is currently inastate offlux and evolution as a result of rapid advances in information and communications technology, and the subsequent changing needs of the digital natives. The study is based on ideas conceptualised from reading several editorialsandarticlesonserver virtualisation technologyandcloudcomputingin several journals, with the eSchool News as the most important one. The paper identifies two cloud computing tools, their salient features and describeshowcloud computing can be used to achieve the ideals of SoTL. Findings â The study reports that the cloud as a ubiquitous computing tool and a powerful platform can enable educators to practise the ideals of SoTL. Two of the most useful free âcloud computingâ applications are the Google Apps for Education which is a free online suite of tools that includes Gmail for e-mail and Google Docs for documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, and Microsoft's cloud service (Live@edu) including the SkyDrive. Using the cloud approach, everybody can work on the same document at the same time to make corrections as well as improve it dynamically in a collaborative manner. Practical implications â Cloud computing has a significant place in higher education in that the appropriate use of cloud computing tools can enhance engagement among students, educators, and researchers in a cost effective manner. There are security concerns but they do not overshadow the benefits. Originality/value â The paper provides insights into the possibility of using cloud computing delivery for originating a new instructional paradigm that makes a shift possible from the traditional practice of teaching as a private affair to a peer-reviewed transparent process, and makes it known how student learning can be improved generally, not only in one's own classroom but also beyond it.

Most of the extant research has focused on server reduction in the consolidation process, but unbalanced resource utilization among different physical machines can cause the waste of physical resources.

In this paper, we propose two ways, from microscopic and macroscopic perspectives, to predict the resource consumption for data centers by statistically characterizing resource usage patterns. The first approach focuses on the usage prediction for a specific node. Compared to the basic method of calibrating AR models for CPU usages separately, we find that using both CPU and memory usage data can improve the forecasting performance. The second approach is based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify resource usage patterns across different nodes. Using the identified patterns, we can reduce the number of parameters for predicting the resource usage on multiple nodes. In addition, using the principal components obtained from PCA, we propose an optimization framework to optimally consolidate VMs into a number of physical servers and in the meanwhile reduce the resource usage variability. The evaluation of the proposed approaches is based on traces collected from a production cloud environment.},

Virtualization technologies are widely used in modern data centers to ease the management of the data center and to reduce its energy consumption. Data centers that employ virtualization technologies are typically called virtualized or cloud data centers. Virtualization technologies enable virtual machine (VM) live migration, which allows the VMs to be freely moved among physical machines (PMs) with negligible downtime. Thus, several VMs can be packed on a single PM so as to let the PM run in its more energy-efficient working condition. This technique is called server consolidation and is an effective and widely used approach to reduce total energy consumption in data centers. Server consolidation can be done in various ways and by considering various parameters and effects. This paper presents a survey and taxonomy for server consolidation techniques in cloud data centers. Special attention has been devoted to the parameters and algorithmic approaches used to consolidate VMs onto PMs. In this end, we also discuss open challenges and suggest areas for further research.},

abstract = {IBM Research Report Isolation and resource control for cloud applications has traditionally been achieve through the use of virtual machines. Deploying applications in a VM results in reduced performance due to the extra levels of abstraction. In a cloud environment, this results in loss efficiency for the infrastructure. Newer advances in container-based virtualization simplifies the deployment of applications while isolating them from one another. In this paper, we explore the performance of traditional virtual machine deployments, and contrast them with the use of Linux containers. We use a suite of workloads that stress the CPU, memory, storage and networking resources. Our results show that containers result in equal or better performance than VM in almost all cases. Both VMs and containers require tuning to support I/O-intensive applicaions. We also discuss the implications of our performance results for future cloud architecture.},

abstract = {Large-scale Internet services require a computing infrastructure that can beappropriately described as a warehouse-sized computing system. The cost ofbuilding datacenter facilities capable of delivering a given power capacity tosuch a computer can rival the recurring energy consumption costs themselves.Therefore, there are strong economic incentives to operate facilities as closeas possible to maximum capacity, so that the non-recurring facility costs canbe best amortized. That is difficult to achieve in practice because ofuncertainties in equipment power ratings and because power consumption tends tovary significantly with the actual computing activity. Effective powerprovisioning strategies are needed to determine how much computing equipmentcan be safely and efficiently hosted within a given power budget. In this paper we present the aggregate power usage characteristics of largecollections of servers (up to 15 thousand) for different classes ofapplications over a period of approximately six months. Those observationsallow us to evaluate opportunities for maximizing the use of the deployed powercapacity of datacenters, and assess the risks of over-subscribing it. We findthat even in well-tuned applications there is a noticeable gap (7 - 16{\%})between achieved and theoretical aggregate peak power usage at the clusterlevel (thousands of servers). The gap grows to almost 40{\%} in wholedatacenters. This headroom can be used to deploy additional compute equipmentwithin the same power budget with minimal risk of exceeding it. We use ourmodeling framework to estimate the potential of power management schemes toreduce peak power and energy usage. We find that the opportunities for powerand energy savings are significant, but greater at the cluster-level (thousandsof servers) than at the rack-level (tens). Finally we argue that systems needto be power efficient across the activity range, and not only at peakperformance levels.},

abstract = {The bin-packing problem is a well known NP-Hard optimisation problem, and, over the years, many heuristics have been developed to generate good quality solutions. This paper outlines a genetic programming system which evolves a heuristic that decides whether to put a piece in a bin when presented with the sum of the pieces already in the bin and the size of the piece that is about to be packed. This heuristic operates in a fixed framework that iterates through the open bins, applying the heuristic to each one, before deciding which bin to use. The best evolved programs emulate the functionality of the human designed first-fit heuristic. Thus, the contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that genetic programming can be employed to automatically evolve bin packing heuristics which are the same as high quality heuristics which have been designed by humans.},

The work in theoretical genetics initiated by R. A. Fisher 5 and Sewall Wright 24 should find a natural place in the theory. At the same time the rigorous methods of automata theory should be brought to bear (particularly those parts concerned with growing automata 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 12, 15, 18, 23). Finally the theory should include among its models abstract counterparts of artificial adaptive systems currently being studied, systems such as Newell-Shaw-Simon's "General Problem Solver" 13, Selfridge's "Pandemonium" 17, von Neumann's self-reproducing automata 22 and Turing's morphogenetic systems 19, 20.},

Cloud applications have different composition, configuration, and deployment requirements. Quantifying the performance of resource allocation policies and application scheduling algorithms at finer details in Cloud computing environments for different application and service models under varying load, energy performance (power consumption, heat dissipation), and system size is a challenging problem to tackle. To simplify this process, in this paper we propose CloudSim: an extensible simulation toolkit that enables modelling and simulation of Cloud computing environments. The CloudSim toolkit supports modelling and creation of one or more virtual machines (VMs) on a simulated node of a Data Center, jobs, and their mapping to suitable VMs. It also allows simulation of multiple Data Centers to enable a study on federation and associated policies for migration of VMs for reliability and automatic scaling of applications.},

abstract = {Bilevel optimization problems are a class of challenging optimization problems, which contain two levels of optimization tasks. In these problems, the optimal solutions to the lower level problem become possible feasible candidates to the upper level problem. Such a requirement makes the optimization problem difficult to solve, and has kept the researchers busy towards devising methodologies, which can efficiently handle the problem. Despite the efforts, there hardly exists any effective methodology, which is capable of handling a complex bilevel problem. In this paper, we introduce bilevel evolutionary algorithm based on quadratic approximations (BLEAQ) of optimal lower level variables with respect to the upper level variables. The approach is capable of handling bilevel problems with different kinds of complexities in relatively smaller number of function evaluations. Ideas from classical optimization have been hybridized with evolutionary methods to generate an efficient optimization algorithm for generic bilevel problems. The efficacy of the algorithm has been shown on two sets of test problems. The first set is a recently proposed SMD test set, which contains problems with controllable complexities, and the second set contains standard test problems collected from the literature. The proposed method has been evaluated against two benchmarks, and the performance gain is observed to be significant.},

The framework supports a wide range of measures for load imbalance and reconfiguration cost, as well as several optimization techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the this framework by using it to balance the workload on a NetApp ONTAP GX system, a commercial scale-out clustered NFS server implementation.

This leads to the formation of a spot price, whose fluctuations can determine customers to be overbid by other users and lose the virtual machine they rented. In this paper we propose a heuristic to automate the decision on: (i) which and how many resources to rent in order to run a cloud application, (ii) how to map the application components to the rented resources, and (iii) what spot price bids to use in order to minimize the total bid price while maintaining an acceptable level of performance. To drive the decision making, our algorithm combines a multi-class queueing network model of the application with a Markov model that describes the stochastic evolution of the spot price and its influence on virtual machine reliability. We show, using a model developed for a real enterprise application and historical traces of the Amazon EC2 spot instance prices, that our heuristic finds low cost solutions that indeed guarantee the required levels of performance. The performance of our heuristic method is compared to that of nonlinear programming and shown to markedly accelerate the finding of low-cost optimal solutions.},

abstract = {A dynamic server migration and consolidation algorithm is introduced. The algorithm is shown to provide substantial improvement over static server consolidation in reducing the amount of required capacity and the rate of service level agreement violations. Benefits accrue for workloads that are variable and can be forecast over intervals shorter than the time scale of demand variability. The management algorithm reduces the amount of physical capacity required to support a specified rate of SLA violations for a given workload by as much as 50{\%} as compared to static consolidation approach. Another result is that the rate of SLA violations at fixed capacity may be reduced by up to 20{\%}. The results are based on hundreds of production workload traces across a variety of operating systems, applications, and industries.},

abstract = {Virtualization has become a key technology for simplifying service management and reducing energy costs in data centers. One of the challenges faced by data centers is to decide when, how, and which virtual machines (VMs) have to be consolidated into a single physical server. Server consolidation involves VM migration, which has a direct impact on service response time. Most of the existing solutions for server consolidation rely on eager migrations, which try to minimize the number of physical servers running VMs. These solutions generate unnecessary migrations due to unpredictable workloads that require VM resizing. This paper proposes an LP formulation and heuristics to control VM migration, which prioritize virtual machines with steady capacity. We performed experiments using TU-Berlin and Google data center workloads to compare our migration control strategy against existing eager-migration-based solutions. We observed that avoiding migration of VMs with steady capacity reduces the number of migrations with minimal penalty in the number of physical servers. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

@inproceedings{Grimes:2016ia,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.Energy consumption in data centres accounts for a significant proportion of national energy usage in many countries. One approach for reducing energy consumption is to improve the server usage efficiency via workload consolidation. However, there are two primary reasons why this is not done to a large extent. The first reason is that greater consolidation could result in violations of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) if resources are over-utilised. The second reason is that users specify the requirements of a virtual machine (VM) based on the maximum estimated usage for each resource over the whole life span of the VM, and usually over-estimate these maximum values to avoid possible contract violations. Typically, the VM will have significantly lower resource usage in most time periods. Recently, a number of methods have been proposed to predict resource usage of VMs. We show that although these prediction techniques are efficient when their performances are measured using well known metrics, a low prediction error can still result in significant violations of SLAs if not handled properly during workload allocation. Our results emphasise the importance of analysing workload prediction in conjunction with workload allocation techniques. We examine the impact of using predicted resource usage for optimal server consolidation. We investigate the occurrences of over-utilised resources on servers due to under-predicted resource usage. We propose methods to reduce the likelihood of such occurrences, both through the enforcement of safety capacities on the server side, and through biasing towards over-prediction on the VM side. The results indicate that an appropriate balance can be found between energy savings and non-violation of SLAs.},

abstract = {The problem of server sprawl is common in data centers of most business organizations. It is most often the case that an application is run on dedicated servers. This leads to situations where organizations end up having numerous servers that remain under-utilized most of the times. The servers, in such scenarios, are allocated more resources (disk, cpu and memory) than are justified by their present workloads. Consolidating multiple underutilized servers into a fewer number of non-dedicated servers that can host multiple applications is an effective tool for businesses to enhance their returns on investment. The problem can be modeled as a variant of the bin packing problem where items to be packed are the servers being consolidated and bins are the target servers. The sizes of the servers/items being packed are resource utilizations which are obtained from the performance trace data. Here we describe a novel two stage heuristic algorithm for taking care of the "bin-item" incompatibility constraints that are inherent in any server consolidation problem. The model is able to solve extremely large instances of problem in a reasonable amount of time.},

abstract = {Cloud computing has emerged as a new and alternative approach for providing computing services. Customers acquire and release resources by requesting and returning virtual machines to the cloud. Different service models and pricing schemes are offered by cloud service providers. This can make it difficult for customers to compare cloud services and select an appropriate solution. Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service vendors offer a t-shirt approach for Virtual Machines (VMs) on demand. Customers can select from a set of fixed size VMs and vary the number of VMs as their demands change. Private clouds often offer another alternative, called time-sharing, where the capacity of each VM is permitted to change dynamically. With this approach each virtual machine is allocated a dynamic amount of CPU and memory resources over time to better utilize available resources. We present a tool that can help customers make informed decisions about which approach works most efficiently for their workloads in aggregate and for each workload separately. A case study using data from an enterprise customer with 312 workloads demonstrates the use of the tool. It shows that for the given set of workloads the t-shirt model requires almost twice the number of physical servers as the time share model. The costs for such infrastructure must ultimately be passed on to the customer in terms of monetary costs or performance risks. We conclude that private and public clouds should consider offering both resource sharing models to meet the needs of customers. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Page sharing identifies virtual machine memory pages with identical content and consolidates them into a single shared page. This technique, implemented at the host level, applies only between VMs placed on a given physical host. In a multi- server data center, opportunities for sharing may be lost because the VMs holding identical pages are resident on different hosts. In order to obtain the full benefit of content-based page sharing it is necessary to place virtual machines such that VMs with similar memory content are located on the same hosts. In this paper we present Memory Buddies, a memory sharing- aware placement system for virtual machines. This system includes a memory fingerprinting system to efficiently determine the sharing potential among a set of VMs, and compute more efficient place- ments. In addition it makes use of live migration to optimize VM placement as workloads change. We have implemented a prototype Memory Buddies system with VMware ESX Server and present experimental results on our testbed, as well as an analysis of an extensive memory trace study. Evaluation of our prototype using a mix of enterprise and e-commerce applications demonstrates an increase of data center capacity (i.e. number of VMs supported) of 17{\%}, while imposing low overhead and scaling to as many as a thousand servers.},

Furthermore, we incorporate a local search scheme into the proposed algorithm, called PSO-LS. Computational results show that the local search can be really guided by PSO in our approach. Also, PSO-LS performs well in flowshop scheduling with total flow time criterion, but it requires more computation times.},

abstract = {The development of low-level heuristics for solving instances of a problem is relatedto the knowledge of an expert. He needs to analyze several components from the problema(sic)(TM) s instance and to think out an specialized heuristic for solving the instance. However if any inherent component to the instance gets changes, then the designed heuristic may not work as it used to do it. In this paper it is presented a novel approach to generated low-level heuristics; the proposed approach implements micro-Differential Evolution for evolving an indirect representation of the Bin Packing Problem. It was used the Hard28 instance, which is a well-known and referenced Bin Packing Problem instance. The heuristics obtained by the proposed approach were compared against the well-know First-Fit heuristic, the results of packing that were gotten for each heuristic were analized by the statistic non-parametric test known as Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test.},

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in cloud computing is one of the most significant and fastest growing field. In this service model, cloud providers offer resources to users/machines that include computers as virtual machines, raw (block) storage, firewalls, load balancers, and network devices. One of the most pressing issues in cloud computing for IaaS is the resource management. Resource management problems include allocation, provisioning, requirement mapping, adaptation, discovery, brokering, estimation, and modeling. Resource management for IaaS in cloud computing offers following benefits: scalability, quality of service, optimal utility, reduced overheads, improved throughput, reduced latency, specialized environment, cost effectiveness and simplified interface. This paper focuses on some of the important resource management techniques such as resource provisioning, resource allocation, resource mapping and resource adaptation. It brings out an exhaustive survey of such techniques for IaaS in cloud computing, and also put forth the open challenges for further research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Exploiting queueing networks theory, we describe a number of linear and non-linear combinatorial optimization problems related to the server consolidation problem. Since their solution is difficult to obtain through standard solution techniques, we propose accurate heuristics which quickly compute a sub-optimal solution and let us deal with hundreds of servers and applications.

As effective as that is, we are likely to see a very different picture a number of years from now, where virtualization will be the key enabling technology for a series of strategic changes in IT. Adaptive resource management using utility computing will be essential to success in an economy with increasing uncertainty. Adapting quickly to new customer demands, new business relationships, and cancelled contracts will be a key business enabler in the modern enterprise, regardless of whether the enterprise executes a software-as-a-service strategy or uses the resource in a more traditional manner. Virtualization will change the way we do testing, with QA departments getting access to a greater variety of resources than they ever had before - at a much lower cost to the business. Similarly, companies that were not proficient in handling reliability, fault tolerance, and business continuity will find in virtualization a new tool that will allow them to make significant progress toward these goals without rewriting all of their software. {\textcopyright} 2008 ACM.},

However, it comes with the price of significant performance degradation of the application executed in the VM due to the large amount of state that needs to be synchronized between the primary and the backup machines. It is therefore critical to find new ways for attaining good performance, and at the same time, maintaining fault tolerant execution. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve the performance of services deployed over replicated virtual machines by exploiting data similarity within the VM's memory image to reduce the network traffic during synchronization. For identifying similar memory areas, we propose a bit density based hash function, upon which, we build a content addressable hash table. We present a quantitative analysis on the degree of similarity we found in various workloads, and introduce a lightweight compression method, which, compared to existing replication techniques, reduces network traffic by up to 80{\%} and yields a performance improvement over 90{\%} for certain latency sensitive applications.},

However, these savings come up with associated risks due to consolidation, particularly when the correlation between applications is not considered. We also investigate the stability in utilization trends for low-risk consolidation. Using the insights from the workload analysis, two new consolidation methods are designed that achieve significant power savings, while containing the performance risk of consolidation.

This paper builds on data center energy modeling efforts by characterizing climate and cooling system differences among data centers and then evaluating their consequences for building energy use. Representative climate conditions for four regions are applied to data center energy models for several different prototypical cooling types. This includes cooling system, supplemental cooling solutions, design conditions and controlling the environment of ICT equipment were generally used for each climate zone, how these affect energy efficiency, and how the prioritization of system selection is derived. Based on the climate classification and the required operating environmental conditions for data centers suggested by the ASHRAE TC 9.9, a dedicated data center energy evaluation tool was taken to examine the potential energy savings of the cooling technology. Incorporating economizer use into the cooling systems would increase the variation in energy efficiency among geographic regions, indicating that as data centers become more energy efficient, their locations will have an increasing effect on overall energy demand. The proposal for the most energy-optimized data center is given by each climate zone.},

abstract = {âIn Infrastructure-as-a-Service cloud data centers, services are provided to cloud customers in the form of virtual machines. Cloud customers can place restrictions on these ser-vices by specifying affinity and anti-affinity constraints. Load imbalance is one key issue that cloud data centers regularly face when running these services. Load imbalance arises when existing services are stopped either by the cloud customers or in the event of host power cycling. One way to achieve load balance in such situations is to perform load rebalancing. Load rebalancing is a process of migrating services among hosts to ensure uniform resource distribution. By doing load rebalanc-ing, SLA violations due to resource shortages on over-utilized hosts can be mitigated. The benefits of load rebalancing come at the expense of migration cost. The presence of affinity and anti-affinity constraints make the load rebalancing challenging. In this paper, we focus on load rebalancing of services with affinity and anti-affinity constraints by applying a novel genetic algorithm. Our objective function aims at reducing the number of migrations and variation of available resources in the hosts. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves a good resource balance while being computationally efficient.},

Often, this growth was achieved in an unplanned way: each time a new application was needed a new server along with the application software was deployed and new storage elements were purchased. In many cases this has led to what is often referred to as "server sprawl", resulting in low server utilization and high system management costs. An architectural approach that is becoming increasingly popular to address this problem is known as server virtualization. In this paper we introduce the concept of server consolidation using virtualization and point out associated issues that arise in the area of application performance. We show how some of these problems can be solved by monitoring key performance metrics and using the data to trigger migration of virtual machines within physical servers. The algorithms we present attempt to minimize the cost of migration and maintain acceptable application performance levels},

abstract = {In this work we consider the following hazmat transportation network design problem. A given set of hazmat shipments has to be shipped over a road transportation network in order to transport a given amount of hazardous materials from specific origin points to specific destination points, and we assume there are regional and local government authorities that want to regulate the hazmat transportations by imposing restrictions on the amount of hazmat traffic over the network links. In particular, the regional authority aims to minimize the total transport risk induced over the entire region in which the transportation network is embedded, while local authorities want the risk over their local jurisdictions to be the lowest possible, forcing the regional authority to assure also risk equity. We provide a linear bilevel programming formulation for this hazmat transportation network design problem that takes into account both total risk minimization and risk equity. We transform the bilevel model into a single-level mixed integer linear program by replacing the second level (follower) problem by its KKT conditions and by linearizing the complementary constraints, and then we solve the MIP problem with a commercial optimization solver. The optimal solution may not be stable, and we provide an approach for testing its stability and for evaluating the range of its solution values when it is not stable. Moreover, since the bilevel model is difficult to be solved optimally and its optimal solution may not be stable, we provide a heuristic algorithm for the bilevel model able to always find a stable solution. The proposed bilevel model and heuristic algorithm are experimented on real scenarios of an Italian regional network. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Business-critical workloads -- web servers, mail servers, app servers, etc. -- are increasingly hosted in virtualized data enters acting as Infrastructure-as-a-Service clouds (cloud data enters). Understanding how business-critical workloads demand and use resources is key in capacity sizing, in infrastructure operation and testing, and in application performance management. However, relatively little is currently known about these workloads, because the information is complex -- larges-scale, heterogeneous, shared-clusters -- and because datacenter operators remain reluctant to share such information. Moreover, the few operators that have shared data (e.g., Google and several supercomputing centers) have enabled studies in business intelligence (MapReduce), search, and scientific computing (HPC), but not in business-critical workloads. To alleviate this situation, in this work we conduct a comprehensive study of business-critical workloads hosted in cloud data enters. We collect two large-scale and long-term workload traces corresponding to requested and actually used resources in a distributed datacenter servicing business-critical workloads. We perform an in-depth analysis about workload traces. Our study sheds light into the workload of cloud data enters hosting business-critical workloads. The results of this work can be used as a basis to develop efficient resource management mechanisms for data enters. Moreover, the traces we released in this work can be used for workload verification, modelling and for evaluating resource scheduling policies, etc.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.Security-as-a-Service (SECaaS), pay-per-use cloud-based services that provides information security measures via the cloud, are increasingly used by corporations to maintain their systems' security posture. Customers often have to provision these SECaaS services based on the potential subscription costs incurred. However, these security services are unable to deal with all possible types of threats. A single threat (e.g. malicious insiders) can result in the loss of valuable data and revenue. Hence, it is also common to see corporations (i.e. cloud customers) manage their risks by purchasing cyber insurance to cover costs and liabilities due to unforeseen losses. A balance between service allocation cost and insurance is often required but not well studied. In this paper, we propose an optimized SECaaS provisioning framework that enables customers to optimally allocate security services from SECaaS providers to their applications, while managing risks from information security breaches via purchasing cyber insurance policies. Finding the right balance is a great challenge, and the solutions of the security service allocation and insurance management are obtained through solving an optimization model derived from stochastic programming with a three-stage recourse. Simulations were conducted to evaluate this optimization model. We exposed our model to several uncertain information parameters and the results are promising - demonstrating an effective approach to balance customers' security requirements while keeping service subscription and insurance policy costs low.},

In this algorithm, the fitness function of PSO is defined as the total Euclidean distance to determine the optimal point between resource utilization and energy consumption. This algorithmcan avoid falling into local optima which is common in traditional heuristic algorithms.

abstract = {We consider the problem of fair resource allocation in a system containing different resource types, where each user may have different demands for each resource. To address this problem, we propose Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF), a generalization of max-min fairness to multiple resource types. We show that DRF, unlike other possible policies, satisï¬es several highly desirable properties. First, DRF incentivizes users to share resources, by ensuring that no user is better off if resources are equally partitioned among them. Second, DRF is strategy-proof, as a user cannot increase her allocation by lying about her requirements. Third, DRF is envyfree, as no user would want to trade her allocation with that of another user. Finally, DRF allocations are Pareto efï¬cient, as it is not possible to improve the allocation of a user without decreasing the allocation of another user. We have implemented DRF in the Mesos cluster resource manager, and show that it leads to better throughput and fairness than the slot-based fair sharing schemes in current cluster schedulers.},

Many techniques, including exact, heuristic, and metaheuristic approaches, have been investigated to solve these problems and it is often not clear which method to use when presented with a new instance. This paper presents an approach which is motivated by the goal of building computer systems which can design heuristic methods. The overall aim is to explore the possibilities for automating the heuristic design process. We present a genetic programming system to automatically generate a good quality heuristic for each instance. It is not necessary to change the methodology depending on the problem type (one-, two-, or three-dimensional knapsack and bin packing problems), and it therefore has a level of generality unmatched by other systems in the literature. We carry out an extensive suite of experiments and compare with the best human designed heuristics in the literature. Note that our heuristic design methodology uses the same parameters for all the experiments. The contribution of this paper is to present a more general packing methodology than those currently available, and to show that, by using this methodology, it is possible for a computer system to design heuristics which are competitive with the human designed heuristics from the literature. This represents the first packing algorithm in the literature able to claim human competitive results in such a wide variety of packing domains.},

abstract = {Cloud computing aims at providing dynamic leasing of server capabilities as scalable, virtualized services to end users. Our work focuses on the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model where custom Virtual Machines (VM) are launched in appropriate servers available in a data center. The cloud data center taken into consideration is heterogeneous and large scale in nature. Such a resource pool is basically characterized by high resource dynamics caused by non-linear variation in the availability of processing elements, memory size, storage capacity, bandwidth and power drawn resulting from the sporadic nature of workload. Apart from the said resource dynamics, our proposed work also considers the processor transitions to various sleep states and their corresponding wake up latencies that are inherent in contemporary enterprise servers. The primary objective of the proposed metascheduler is to map efficiently a set of VM instances onto a set of servers from a highly dynamic resource pool by fulfilling resource requirements of maximum number of workloads. As the cloud data centers are overprovisioned to meet the unexpected workload surges, huge power consumption has become one of the major issues of concern. We have proposed a novel metascheduler called Adaptive Power-Aware Virtual Machine Provisioner (APA-VMP) that schedules the workload in such a way that the total incremental power drawn by the server pool is minimum without compromising the performance objectives. The APA-VMP makes use of swarm intelligence methodology to detect and track the changing optimal target servers for VM placement very efficiently. The scenario was experimented by novel Self-adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (SAPSO) for VM provisioning, which makes best possible use of the power saving states of idle servers and instantaneous workload on the operational servers. It is evident from the results that there is a significant reduction in the power numbers against the existing strategies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Based on a pay-as-you-go model, it enables hosting of pervasive applications from consumer, scientific, and business domains. However, data centers hosting Cloud applications consume huge amounts of electrical energy, contributing to high operational costs and carbon footprints to the environment. Therefore, we need Green Cloud computing solutions that can not only minimize operational costs but also reduce the environmental impact.

Based on this architecture, we present our vision, open research challenges, and resource provisioning and allocation algorithms for energy-efficient management of Cloud computing environments. The proposed energy-aware allocation heuristics provision data center resources to client applications in a way that improves energy efficiency of the data center, while delivering the negotiated Quality of Service (QoS). In particular, in this paper we conduct a survey of research in energy-efficient computing and propose: (a) architectural principles for energy-efficient management of Clouds; (b) energy-efficient resource allocation policies and scheduling algorithms considering QoS expectations and power usage characteristics of the devices; and (c) a number of open research challenges, addressing which can bring substantial benefits to both resource providers and consumers. We have validated our approach by conducting a performance evaluation study using the CloudSim toolkit. The results demonstrate that Cloud computing model has immense potential as it offers significant cost savings and demonstrates high potential for the improvement of energy efficiency under dynamic workload scenarios.},

For a virtualized data center, optimizing the placement of virtual machines (VMs) dynamically is one of the most effective methods for power savings. Based on a deep study on VMs placement, a solution is proposed and described in this paper to solve the problem of dynamic placement of VMs toward optimization of their energy consumptions. A computational model of energy consumption is proposed and built. A novel algorithm based on evolutionary game theory is also presented, which successfully addresses the challenges faced by dynamic placement of VMs. It is proved that the proposed algorithm can reach the optimal solutions theoretically. Experimental results also demonstrate that, by adjusting VMs placement dynamically, the energy consumption can be reduced correspondingly. In comparison with the existing state of the arts, our proposed method outperforms other five algorithms tested and achieves savings of 30â40{\%} on energy consumption. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Server consolidation using virtualization technology has become increasingly important for improving data center efficiency. It enables one physical server to host multiple independent virtual machines (VMs), and the transparent movement of workloads from one server to another. Fine-grained virtual machine resource allocation and reallocation are possible in order to meet the performance targets of applications running on virtual machines. On the other hand, these capabilities create demands on system management, especially for large-scale data centers. In this paper, a two-level control system is proposed to manage the mappings of workloads to VMs and VMs to physical resources. The focus is on the VM placement problem which is posed as a multi-objective optimization problem of simultaneously minimizing total resource wastage, power consumption and thermal dissipation costs. An improved genetic algorithm with fuzzy multi-objective evaluation is proposed for efficiently searching the large solution space and conveniently combining possibly conflicting objectives. The simulation-based evaluation using power-consumption and thermal-dissipation models based on profiling of a Blade Center, demonstrates the good performance, scalability and robustness of our proposed approach. Compared with four well-known bin-packing algorithms and two single-objective approaches, the solutions obtained from our approach seek good balance among the conflicting objectives while others cannot.},

Thus, multiple virtual servers can be hosted on a single server. Server consolidation describes the process of combining the workloads of several different servers on a set of target servers. We focus on server consolidation with dozens or hundreds of servers, which can be regularly found in enterprise data centers. Cost saving is among the key drivers for such projects. This paper presents decision models to optimally allocate source servers to physical target servers while considering real-world constraints. Our central model is proven to be an NP-hard problem. Therefore, besides an exact solution method, a heuristic is presented to address large-scale server consolidation projects. In addition, a preprocessing method for server load data is introduced allowing for the consideration of quality-of-service levels. Extensive experiments were conducted based on a large set of server load data from a data center provider focusing on managerial concerns over what types of problems can be solved. Results show that, on average, server savings of 31 percent can be achieved only by taking cycles in the server workload into account.},

We have built a model to estimate the power consumption from the observation of experimental data that consists of tracking the CPU utilization and detecting the operation parameters of the measured servers. When calculated in real time, the CPU utilization can respond to the dynamic change of the power consumption of the measured servers. The operation parameters represent the hardware configuration of the measured servers. We also propose three methods to obtain these parameters: filled- manually, hardware-revised, and software-revised parameter estimating. We have constructed the virtual-instrumentation software according to this power model to measure the power consumption of the streaming-media server. To facilitate the measurement process, we have also designed a suitable graphic-user interface for it. Our virtual-instrumentation software with three parameter-estimating methods has been tested by way of comparison with measurement results obtained by a power meter. The average power values of the hardware-revised method are found to yield mean errors of the estimate within 3{\%}. The mean error of the software-revised method is within 6{\%}. However, the filled- manually method may underestimate the power consumption by as much as 11{\%}.},

abstract = {There has been a growing effort in decreasing energy consumption of large-scale cloud data centers via maximization of host-level utilization and load balancing techniques. However, with the recent introduction of Container as a Service (CaaS) by cloud providers, maximizing the utilization at virtual machine (VM) level becomes essential. To this end, this paper focuses on finding efficient virtual machine sizes for hosting containers in such a way that the workload is executed with minimum wastage of resources on VM level. Suitable VM sizes for containers are calculated, and application tasks are grouped and clustered based on their usage patterns obtained from historical data. Furthermore, tasks are mapped to containers and containers are hosted on their associated VM types. We analyzed clouds' trace logs from Google cluster and consider the cloud work- load variances, which is crucial for testing and validating our proposed solutions. Experimental results showed up to 7.55{\%} improvement in the average energy consumption compared to baseline scenarios where the virtual machine sizes are fixed. In addition, comparing to the baseline scenarios, the total number of VMs instantiated for hosting the containers is also improved by 68{\%} on average. I.},

abstract = {Numerous systems have been designed which use virtualization to subdivide the ample resources of a modern computer. Some require specialized hardware, or cannot support commodity operating systems. Some target 100{\%} binary compatibility at the expense of performance. Others sacrifice security or functionality for speed. Few offer resource isolation or performance guarantees; most provide only best-effort provisioning, risking denial of service.This paper presents Xen, an x86 virtual machine monitor which allows multiple commodity operating systems to share conventional hardware in a safe and resource managed fashion, but without sacrificing either performance or functionality. This is achieved by providing an idealized virtual machine abstraction to which operating systems such as Linux, BSD and Windows XP, can be ported with minimal effort.Our design is targeted at hosting up to 100 virtual machine instances simultaneously on a modern server. The virtualization approach taken by Xen is extremely efficient: we allow operating systems such as Linux and Windows XP to be hosted simultaneously for a negligible performance overhead --- at most a few percent compared with the unvirtualized case. We considerably outperform competing commercial and freely available solutions in a range of microbenchmarks and system-wide tests.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of energy-aware resource allocation for hosting long-term services or on-demand computing jobs in clusters, e.g., deployed as part of computing infrastructures. We formalize the problem as three constrained optimization problems: maximize job performance under power consumption constraints, minimize power consumption under job performance constraints, and optimize a linear combination of power consumption and job performance. These problems are NP-hard but, given an instance, a bound on the optimal solution can be computed via a rational linear program. We propose polynomial heuristics for all three problems. Simulation experiments show that in all three cases some heuristics can achieve results close to optimal, i.e., lead to good job performance while conserving energy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We report on empirical evaluations of the FFD-based, as well as the new heuristics on large families of distributions. We identify which FFD variants work best in most cases and show that our new heuristics usually outperform FFD-based heuristics and can sometimes reduce the number of bins used by up to ten percent. Further, in all cases where we were able to compute the optimal solution we found our new heuristics within few percent of optimal. We conclude that these new heuristics are an excellent alternative to FFD-based heuristics and are prime candidates to be used in practice.},

abstract = {Server consolidation based on virtualization is an important technique for improving power efficiency and resource utilization in cloud infrastructures. However, to ensure satisfactory performance on shared resources under changing application workloads, dynamic management of the resource pool via online adaptation is critical. The inherent tradeoffs between power and performance as well as between the cost of an adaptation and its benefits make such management challenging. In this paper, we present Mistral, a holistic controller framework that optimizes power consumption, performance benefits, and the transient costs incurred by various adaptations and the controller itself to maximize overall utility. Mistral can handle multiple distributed applications and large-scale infrastructures through a multi-level adaptation hierarchy and scalable optimization algorithm. We show that our approach outstrips other strategies that address the tradeoff between only two of the objectives (power, performance, and transient costs).},

abstract = {Server farms today consume more than 1.5{\%} of the total electricity in the U.S. at a cost of nearly {\$}4.5 billion. Given the rising cost of energy, many industries are now seeking solutions for how to best make use of their available power. An important question which arises in this context is how to distribute available power among servers in a server farm so as to get maximum performance. By giving more power to a server, one can get higher server frequency (speed). Hence it is commonly believed that, for a given power budget, performance can be maximized by operating servers at their highest power levels. However, it is also conceivable that one might prefer to run servers at their lowest power levels, which allows more servers to be turned on for a given power budget. To fully understand the effect of power allocation on performance in a server farm with a fixed power budget, we introduce a queueing theoretic model, which allows us to predict the optimal power allocation in a variety of scenarios. Results are verified via extensive experiments on an IBM BladeCenter. We find that the optimal power allocation varies for different scenarios. In particular, it is not always optimal to run servers at their maximum power levels. There are scenarios where it might be optimal to run servers at their lowest power levels or at some intermediate power levels. Our analysis shows that the optimal power allocation is non-obvious and depends on many factors such as the power-to-frequency relationship in the processors, the arrival rate of jobs, the maximum server frequency, the lowest attainable server frequency and the server farm configuration. Furthermore, our theoretical model allows us to explore more general settings than we can implement, including arbitrarily large server farms and different power-to-frequency curves. Importantly, we show that the optimal power allocation can significantly improve server farm performance, by a factor of typically 1.4 and as much as a factor of 5 in some cases.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.Focus in the paper is on optimality conditions for bilevel programming problems. We start with a general condition using tangent cones of the feasible set of the bilevel programming problem to derive such conditions for the optimistic bilevel problem. More precise conditions are obtained if the tangent cone possesses an explicit description as it is possible in the case of linear lower level problems. If the optimal solution of the lower level problem is a PC1-function, sufficient conditions for a global optimal solution of the optimistic bilevel problem can be formulated. In the second part of the paper relations of the bilevel programming problem to set-valued optimization problems and to mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints are given which can also be used to formulate optimality conditions for the original problem. Finally, a variational inequality approach is described which works well when the involved functions are monotone. It consists in a variational re-formulation of the optimality conditions and looking for a solution of the thus obtained variational inequality among the points satisfying the initial constraints. A penalty function technique is applied to get a sequence of approximate solutions converging to a solution of the original problem with monotone operators.},

Energy consumption models are pivotal in designing and optimizing energy-efficient operations to curb excessive energy consumption in data centers. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art techniques used for energy consumption modeling and prediction for data centers and their components. We conduct an in-depth study of the existing literature on data center power modeling, covering more than 200 models. We organize these models in a hierarchical structure with two main branches focusing on hardware-centric and software-centric power models. Under hardware-centric approaches we start from the digital circuit level and move on to describe higher-level energy consumption models at the hardware component level, server level, data center level, and finally systems of systems level. Under the software-centric approaches we investigate power models developed for operating systems, virtual machines and software applications. This systematic approach allows us to identify multiple issues prevalent in power modeling of different levels of data center systems, including: i) few modeling efforts targeted at power consumption of the entire data center ii) many state-of-the-art power models are based on a few CPU or server metrics, and iii) the effectiveness and accuracy of these power models remain open questions. Based on these observations, we conclude the survey by describing key challenges for future research on constructing effective and accurate data center power models.},

abstract = {In multiobjective optimization problems, the identified Pareto Frontiers and Sets often con- tain too many solutions, which make it difficult for the decision maker to select a preferred alternative. To facilitate the selection task, decision making support tools can be used in different instances of the multiobjective optimization search to introduce preferences on the objectives or to give a condensed representation of the solutions on the Pareto Frontier, so as to offer to the decision maker a manageable picture of the solution alternatives. This paper presents a comparison of some a priori and a posteriori decision making support methods, aimed at aiding the decision maker in the selection of the preferred solutions. The considered methods are compared with respect to their application to a case study concerning the optimization of the test intervals of the components of a safety system of a nuclear power plant. The engine for the multiobjective optimization search is based on genetic algorithms.},

abstract = {Parameter Sweep Experiments (PSEs) allow scientists and engineers to conduct experiments by running the same program code against different input data. This usually results in many jobs with high computational requirements. Thus, distributed environments, particularly Clouds, can be employed to fulfill these demands. However, job scheduling is challenging as it is an NP-complete problem. Recently, Cloud schedulers based on bio-inspired techniques-which work well in approximating problems with little input information-have been proposed. Unfortunately, existing proposals ignore job priorities, which is a very important aspect in PSEs since it allows accelerating PSE results processing and visualization in scientific Clouds. We present a new Cloud scheduler based on Ant Colony Optimization, the most popular bio-inspired technique, which also exploits well-known notions from operating systems theory. Simulated experiments performed with real PSE job data and other Cloud scheduling policies indicate that our proposal allows for a more agile job handling while reducing PSE completion time. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Computation-intensive design problems are becoming increasingly common in manufacturing industries. The computation burden is often caused by expensive analysis and simulation processes in order to reach a comparable level of accuracy as physical testing data. To address such a challenge, approximation or metamodeling techniques are often used. Metamodeling techniques have been developed from many different disciplines including statistics, mathematics, computer science, and various engineering disciplines. These metamodels are initially developed as âsurrogatesâ of the expensive simulation process in order to improve the overall computation efficiency. They are then found to be a valuable tool to support a wide scope of activities in modern engineering design, especially design optimization. This work reviews the state-of-the-art metamodel-based techniques from a practitioner's perspective according to the role of metamodeling in supporting design optimization, including model approximation, design space exploration, problem formulation, and solving various types of optimization problems. Challenges and future development of metamodeling in support of engineering design is also analyzed and discussed.},

Since VM consolidation problem is strictly NP-hard, many heuristic algorithms have been proposed to tackle the problem. However, most of the existing works deal only with minimizing the number of hosts based on their current resource utilization and these works do not explore the future resource requirements. Therefore, unnecessary VM migrations are generated and the rate of Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations are increased in data centers. To address this problem, our VM consolidation method which is formulated as a bin-packing problem considers both the current and future utilization of resources. The future utilization of resources is accurately predicted using a k-nearest neighbor regression based model. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of VM and host resource utilization predictions in the VM consolidation task using real workload traces. The experimental results show that our approach provides substantial improvement over other heuristic algorithms in reducing energy consumption, number of VM migrations and number of SLA violations. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {System virtualization is becoming pervasive and it is enabling important new computing diagrams such as cloud computing. Live virtual machine (VM) migration is a unique capability of system virtualization which allows applications to be transparently moved across physical machines with a consistent state captured by their VMs. Although live VM migration is generally fast, it is a resource-intensive operation and can impact the application performance and resource usage of the migrating VM as well as other concurrent VMs. However, existing studies on live migration performance are often based on the assumption that there are sufficient resources on the source and destination hosts, which is often not the case for highly consolidated systems. As the scale of virtualized systems such as clouds continue to grow, the use of live migration becomes increasingly more important for managing performance and reliability in such systems. Therefore, it is key to understand the performance of live VM migration under different levels of resource availability. This paper addresses this need by creating performance models for live migration which can be used to predict a VM's migration time given its application's behavior and the resources available to the migration. A series of experiments were conducted on Xen to profile the time for migrating a DomU VM running different resource-intensive applications while Dom0 is allocated different CPU shares for processing the migration. Regression methods are then used to create the performance model based on the profiling data. The results show that the VM's migration time is indeed substantially impacted by Dom0's CPU allocation whereas the performance model can accurately capture this relationship with the coefficient of determination generally higher than 90{\{}{\%}{\}}.},

In EnaCloud, we use a Virtual Machine to encapsulate the application, which supports applications scheduling and live migration to minimize the number of running machines, so as to save energy. Specially, the application placement is abstracted as a bin packing problem, and an energy-aware heuristic algorithm is proposed to get an appropriate solution. In addition, an over-provision approach is presented to deal with the varying resource demands of applications. Our approach has been successfully implemented as useful components and fundamental services in the iVIC platform.

Cloud computing has become a main medium for Software as a Service (SaaS) providers to host their SaaS as it can provide the scalability a SaaS requires. The challenges in the composite SaaS placement process rely on several factors including the large size of the Cloud network, SaaS competing resource requirements, SaaS interactions between its components and SaaS interactions with its data components. However, existing applications' placement methods in data centres are not concerned with the placement of the component's data. In addition, a Cloud network is much larger than data center networks that have been discussed in existing studies. This paper proposes a penalty-based genetic algorithm (GA) to the composite SaaS placement problem in the Cloud. We believe this is the first attempt to the SaaS placement with its data in Cloud provider's servers. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and the scalability of the GA.},

abstract = {Resource provisioning in compute clouds often require an estimate of the capacity needs of Virtual Machines (VMs). The estimated VM size is the basis for allocating resources commensurate with workload demand. In contrast to the traditional practice of estimating the VM sizes individually, we propose a joint-VM sizing approach in which multiple VMs are consolidated and provisioned, based on an estimate of their aggregate capacity needs. This new approach exploits statistical multiplexing among the workload patterns of multiple VMs, i.e., the peaks and valleys in one workload pattern do not necessarily coincide with the others. Thus, the unused resources of a low utilized VM can be directed to the other co-located VMs with high utilization. Compared to individual VM based provisioning, joint-VM sizing and provisioning may lead to much higher resource utilization. This paper presents three design modules to enable the concept in practice. Specifically, a performance constraint describing the capacity need of a VM for achieving a certain level of application performance; an algorithm for estimating the size of jointly provisioning VMs; a VM selection method that seeks to find good VM combinations for being provisioned together. We showcase that the proposed three modules can be seamlessly plugged into existing applications such as resource provisioning, and providing resource guarantees for VMs. The proposed algorithms and applications are evaluated by monitoring data collected from about 16 thousand VMs in commercial data centers. These evaluations reveal more than 45{\%} improvements in terms of the overall resource utilization.},

abstract = {Dynamic consolidation of virtual machines (VMs) is an effective way to improve the utilization of resources and energy efficiency in cloud data centers. Determining when it is best to reallocate VMs from an overloaded host is an aspect of dynamic VM consolidation that directly influences the resource utilization and quality of service (QoS) delivered by the system. The influence on the QoS is explained by the fact that server overloads cause resource shortages and performance degradation of applications. Current solutions to the problem of host overload detection are generally heuristic based, or rely on statistical analysis of historical data. The limitations of these approaches are that they lead to suboptimal results and do not allow explicit specification of a QoS goal. We propose a novel approach that for any known stationary workload and a given state configuration optimally solves the problem of host overload detection by maximizing the mean intermigration time under the specified QoS goal based on a Markov chain model. We heuristically adapt the algorithm to handle unknown nonstationary workloads using the Multisize Sliding Window workload estimation technique. Through simulations with workload traces from more than a thousand PlanetLab VMs, we show that our approach outperforms the best benchmark algorithm and provides approximately 88 percent of the performance of the optimal offline algorithm. {\textcopyright} 1990-2012 IEEE.},

We use time-series analysis techniques to extract not only low frequency information about future VM workloads but also high frequency information for VM workload correlations. We show that the proposed algorithms mathematically guarantee the VM scheduling meets the Service Level Objectives (SLO) and, moreover, guarantee statistically that the desired success probability of the SLO is met. Evaluation of our technique on production (real) workloads shows that our approach reduces by up to 15{\%} the number of physical machines.

abstract = {Cloud computing is gaining popularity as a way to virtualize the datacenter and increase flexibility in the use of computation resources. This type of system is best exemplified by Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud and related products. Recently, a new open-source framework called Eucalyptus has been released that allows users to create private cloud computing grids that are API-compatible with the existing Amazon standards. Eucalyptus leverages existing virtualization technology (the KVM or Xen hypervisors) and popular Linux distributions. Through the use of automated scripts provided with Ubuntu, a private cloud can be installed, from scratch, in under 30 minutes. Here, Eucalyptus is tested using I/O intensive applications in order to determine if its performance is as good as its ease-of-use. Unfortunately, limitations in commodity I/O virtualization technology restrict the out-of-the-box storage bandwidth to 51{\%} and 77{\%} of a non-virtualized disk for writes and reads, respectively. Similarly, out-of-the-box network bandwidth to another host is only 71{\%} and 45{\%} of non-virtualized performance for transmit and receive workloads, respectively. These bottlenecks are present even on a test system massively over-provisioned in both memory and computation resources. Similar restrictions are also evident in commercial clouds provided by Amazon, showing that even after much research effort I/O virtualization bottlenecks still challenge the designers of modern systems.},

In recent years, Web services technology is becoming increasingly popular because of the convenience, low cost and capacity to be composed into high-level business processes. The service location-allocation problem for a Web service provider is critical and urgent, because some factors such as network latency can make serious effect on the quality of service (QoS). This paper presents a multi-objective optimization algorithm based on NSGA-II to solve the service location-allocation problem. A stimulated experiment is conducted using the WS-DREAM dataset. The results are compared with a single objective genetic algorithm (GA). It shows NSGA-II based algorithm can provide a set of best solutions that outperforms genetic algorithm.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017. Web services are independently programmable application components which scatter over the Internet. Network latency is one of the major concerns of web service application. Thus, physical locations of web services and users should be taken into account for web service composition. In this paper, we propose a new solution based on the modified binary PSO-based (MBPSO) approach which employs an adaptive inertia technique to allocating web service locations. Although several heuristic approaches have been proposed for web service location-allocation, to our best knowledge, this is the first time applying PSO to solve the problem. A simulated experiment is done using the WS-DREAM dataset with five different complexities. To compare with genetic algorithm and original binary PSO approaches, the proposed MBPSO approach has advantages in most situations.},

abstract = {The new ways of doing science, rooted on the unprecedented processing, communication and storage infrastructures that became available to scientists, are collectively called e-Science. Many research labs now need non-trivial computational power to run e-Science applications. Grid and voluntary computing are well-established solutions that cater to this need, but are not accessible for all labs and institutions. Besides, there is an uncertainty about the future amount of resources that will be available in such infrastructures, which prevents the researchers from planning their activities to guarantee that deadlines will be met. With the emergence of the cloud computing paradigm come new opportunities. One possibility is to run e-Science activities at resources acquired on-demand from cloud providers. However, although very low, there is a cost associated with the usage of cloud resources. Besides that, the amount of resources that can be simultaneously acquired is, in practice, limited. Another possibility is the not new idea of composing hybrid infrastructures in which the huge amount of computational resources shared by the grid infrastructures are used whenever possible and extra capacity is acquired from cloud computing providers. We here investigate how to schedule e-Science activities in such hybrid infrastructures so that deadlines are met and costs are reduced.},

abstract = {Efficient mapping of Virtual Machines{\~{}}(VMs) onto physical servers is a key problem for cloud infrastructure providers as hardware utilization directly impacts profit. Today, this mapping is commonly only performed when new VMs are created, but as VM workloads fluctuate and server availability varies, any initial mapping is bound to become suboptimal over time. We introduce a set of heuristic methods for continuous optimization of the VM-to-server mapping based on combinations of fundamental management actions, namely suspending and resuming physical machines, migrating VMs, and suspending and resuming VMs. By using these methods, cloud infrastructure providers can continuously optimize their server resources regardless of the predictability of the workload. To verify that our approach is applicable in real-world scenarios, we build a proof-of-concept datacenter management system that implements the proposed algorithms. The feasibility of our approach is evaluated through a combination of simulations and real experiments where our system provisions a workload of benchmark applications. Our results indicate that the proposed algorithms are feasible, that the combined management approach achieves the best results, and that the VM suspend and resume mechanism has the largest impact on provider profit.},

abstract = {In the bin packing problem we are given an instance consisting of a sequence of items with sizes between 0 and 1. The objective is to pack these items into the smallest possible number of bins of unit size. FirstFit algorithm packs each item into the first bin where it fits, possibly opening a new bin if the item cannot fit into any currently open bin. In early seventies it was shown that the asymptotic approximation ratio of FirstFit bin packing is equal to 1.7. We prove that also the absolute approximation ratio for FirstFit bin packing is exactly 1.7. This means that if the optimum needs OPT bins, FirstFit always uses at most $\backslash$lfloor 1.7 OPT $\backslash$rfloor bins. Furthermore we show matching lower bounds for a majority of values of OPT, i.e., we give instances on which FirstFit uses exactly $\backslash$lfloor 1.7 OPT $\backslash$rfloor bins. Such matching upper and lower bounds were previously known only for finitely many small values of OPT. The previous published bound on the absolute approximation ratio of FirstFit was 12/7 $\backslash$approx 1.7143. Recently a bound of 101/59 $\backslash$approx 1.7119 was claimed.},

abstract = {Virtualization technology enables multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server. VMs that run on the same physical server can share memory pages that have identical content, thereby reducing the overall memory requirements on the server. We develop sharing-aware algorithms that can colocate VMs with similar page content on the same physical server to optimize the benefits of inter-VM sharing. We show that inter-VM sharing occurs in a largely hierarchical fashion, where the sharing can be attributed to VM's running the same OS platform, OS version, software libraries, or applications. We propose two hierarchical sharing models: a tree model and a more general cluster-tree model. Using a set of VM traces, we show that up to 67{\%} percent of the inter-VM sharing is captured by the tree model and up to 82{\%} is captured by the cluster-tree model. Next, we study two problem variants of critical interest to a virtualization service provider: the VM Maximization problem that determines the most profitable subset of the VMs that can be packed into the given set of servers, and the VM packing problem that determines the smallest set of servers that can accommodate a set of VMs. While both variants are NP-hard, we show that both admit provably good approximation schemes in the hierarchical sharing models. We show that VM maximization for the tree and cluster-tree models can be approximated in polytime to within a (1 - 1/e) factor of optimal. Further, we show that VM packing can be approximated in polytime to within a factor of O(log n) of optimal for cluster-trees and to within a factor of 3 of optimal for trees, where n is the number of VMs. Finally, we evaluate our VM packing algorithm for the tree sharing model on real-world VM traces and show that our algorithm can exploit most of the available inter-VM sharing to achieve a 32{\%} to 50{\%} reduction in servers and a 25{\%} to 57{\%} reduction in memory footprint compared to sharing-oblivious algorithms.},

abstract = {As the requirements and scale of cloud environments increase, scalable management of the cloud is needed. Centralized solutions lack scalability and fully distributed management systems only have a limited overview of the system. One of the often-studied problems in cloud environments is the application placement problem, used to decide where application instances are instantiated and how many resources to allocate to the instances. In this paper a general approach is introduced for using centralized cloud resource management algorithms in a hierarchical context, increasing the scalability of the management system while maintaining a high placement quality. The management system itself is executed on the cloud, further increasing scalability and robustness. The proposed method uses aggregation techniques to generate input values for a centralized application placement algorithm which is run in all management nodes. Decoupling ensures management nodes can function independently. Subsequently, we compare the performance of hierarchical application placement method with that of a fully centralized algorithm. The results show that a solution, within 5{\%} of the optimum placement when using the centralized algorithm, can be achieved hierarchically in less than 25{\%} of the time needed for execution of the centralized algorithm.},

Several past solutions have individually evaluated different techniques to address separate aspects of this problem, in hardware and software, and at local and global levels. Unfortunately, there has been no corresponding work on coordinating all these solutions. In the absence of such coordination, these solutions are likely to interfere with one another, in unpredictable (and potentially dangerous) ways. This paper seeks to address this problem. We make two key contributions. First, we propose and validate a power management solution that coordinates different individual approaches. Using simulations based on 180 server traces from nine different real-world enterprises, we demonstrate the correctness, stability, and efficiency advantages of our solution. Second, using our unified architecture as the base, we perform a detailed quantitative sensitivity analysis and draw conclusions about the impact of different architectures, implementations, workloads, and system design choices.},

abstract = {Sharing of physical infrastructure using virtualization presents an opportunity to improve the overall resource utilization. It is extremely important for a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider to understand the characteristics of the business application workload in order to size and place the virtual machine (VM) containing the application. A typical business application has a multi-tier architecture and the application workload is often predictable. Using the knowledge of the application architecture and statistical analysis of the workload, one can obtain an appropriate capacity and a good placement strategy for the corresponding VM. In this paper we propose a tool iCirrus-WoP that determines VM capacity and VM collocation possibilities for a given set of application workloads. We perform an empirical analysis of the approach on a set of business application workloads obtained from geographically distributed data centers. The iCirrus-WoP tool determines the fixed reserved capacity and a shared capacity of a VM which it can share with another collocated VM. Based on the workload variation, the tool determines if the VM should be statically allocated or needs a dynamic placement. To determine the collocation possibility, iCirrus-WoP performs a peak utilization analysis of the workloads. The empirical analysis reveals the possibility of collocating applications running in different time-zones. The VM capacity that the tool recommends, show a possibility of improving the overall utilization of the infrastructure by more than 70{\%} if they are appropriately collocated. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

While social media is a valuable tool for outreach and the sharing of ideas, there is a danger that this form of communication is gaining too high a value and that we are losing sight of key metrics of scientific value, such as citation indices. To help quantify this, I propose the 'Kardashian Index', a measure of discrepancy between a scientist's social media profile and publication record based on the direct comparison of numbers of citations and Twitter followers.},

Understanding the Netflix architecture and its performance can shed light on how to best optimize its design as well as on the design of similar on-demand streaming services. In this paper, we perform a measurement study of Netflix to uncover its architecture and service strategy. We find that Netflix employs a blend of data centers and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for content distribution. We also perform active measurements of the three CDNs employed by Netflix to quantify the video delivery bandwidth available to users across the US. Finally, as improvements to Netflix's current CDN assignment strategy, we propose a measurement-based adaptive CDN selection strategy and a multiple-CDN-based video delivery strategy, and demonstrate their potentials in significantly increasing user's average bandwidth.},

However, invoking all the available cloud components from user-side for evaluation purpose is expensive and impractical. To address this critical challenge, we propose a neighborhood-based approach, called CloudPred, for collaborative and personalized quality prediction of cloud components. CloudPred is enhanced by feature modeling on both users and components. Our approach CloudPred requires no additional invocation of cloud components on behalf of the cloud application designers. The extensive experimental results show that CloudPred achieves higher QoS prediction accuracy than other competing methods.

Nowadays, data centers (DCs) contain thousands of different machines running a huge number of diverse applications over an extended period. Resource management in Cloud is an open issue since an efficient resource allocation can reduce the infrastructure running cost. In this paper, we propose a snapshot-based solution for server consolidation problem from Cloud infrastructure provider (CIP) perspective. Our proposed mathematical formulation aims at reducing power cost by employing efficient server consolidation, and also considering the issues such as (i) mapping incoming and failing virtual machines (VMs), (ii) reducing a total number of VM migrations and (iii) consolidating running server workloads. We also compare the performance of our proposed model to the well-known Best Fit heuristics and its extension to include server consolidation via VM migration denoted as Best Fit with Consolidation (BFC). Our proposed mathematical formulation allows us to measure the solution quality in absolute terms, and it can also be applicable in practice. In our simulations, we show that relevant improvements (from 6{\%} to 15{\%}) over the widely adopted Best Fit algorithm achieved in a reasonable computing time.},

In order to find optimal or near-optimal solutions fast, we resolve two difficulties: non-linearity of the power model and integer decision variables. We first show how to linearize the problem, and then give a relaxation and iterative rounding algorithm. Computation experiments have shown that the algorithm can solve the problem much faster than the standard integer programming algorithms, and it consistently yields near-optimal solutions.

abstract = {Virtualization technologies changed the way data centers of enterprises utilize their server resources. Instead of using dedicated servers for each type of application, virtualization allows viewing resources as a pool of unified resources, thereby reducing complexity and easing manageability. Server consolidation technique, which deals with reducing the number of servers used by consolidating applications, is one of the main applications of virtualization in data centers. The latter technique helps to use computing resources more effectively and has many benefits, such as reducing costs of power, cooling and, hence, contributes to the Green IT initiative. In a dynamic data center environment, where applications encapsulated as virtual machines are mapped to and released from the nodes frequently, reducing the number of server nodes used can be achieved by migrating applications without stopping their services, the technology known as live migration. However, live migration is a costly operation; hence, how to perform periodic server consolidation operation in a migration-aware way is a challenging task. We propose server consolidation algorithm â Sercon, which not only minimizes the overall number of used servers, but also minimizes the number of migrations. We verify the feasibility of our algorithm along with showing its scalability by conducting experiments with eight different test cases.},

abstract = {The rapid growth in demand for computational power driven by modern service applications combined with the shift to the Cloud computing model have led to the establishment of large-scale virtualized data centers. Such data centers consume enormous amounts of electrical energy resulting in high operating costs and carbon dioxide emissions. Dynamic consolidation of virtual machines (VMs) using live migration and switching idle nodes to the sleep mode allows Cloud providers to optimize resource usage and reduce energy consumption. However, the obligation of providing high quality of service to customers leads to the necessity in dealing with the energy-performance trade-off, as aggressive consolidation may lead to performance degradation. Because of the variability of workloads experienced by modern applications, the VM placement should be optimized continuously in an online manner. To understand the implications of the online nature of the problem, we conduct a competitive analysis and prove competitive ratios of optimal online deterministic algorithms for the single VM migration and dynamic VM consolidation problems. Furthermore, we propose novel adaptive heuristics for dynamic consolidation of VMs based on an analysis of historical data from the resource usage by VMs. The proposed algorithms significantly reduce energy consumption, while ensuring a high level of adherence to the service level agreement. We validate the high efficiency of the proposed algorithms by extensive simulations using real-world workload traces from more than a thousand PlanetLab VMs. Copyright 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

However, due to the stateful feature, new virtualization technology, stringent low latency requirements and unexpected workload changes, key-value stores deployed in cloud environment have to face new challenges for data migration: effects of VM interference, and the need to trade off between the two ingredients of migration cost, say migration time and performance impact. To address these challenges, we focus on the data migration problem in a load rebalancing scenario and build a new framework that aims to rebalance load while minimizing migration costs. We build two interference-aware prediction models to predict the migration time and performance impact for each action using statistical machine learning and then create a cost model to strike a right balance between the two ingredients of cost. A cost-aware migration algorithm is designed to utilize the cost model and balance rate to guide the choice of possible migration actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the data migration approach as well as the cost model and two prediction models using YCSB.},

abstract = {The Green Grid is an association of IT professionals seeking to dramatically raise the energy effi ciency of datacenters through a series of short-term and long-term proposals. This is an update to the very fi rst white paper published by the Green Grid in February 2007 called âGreen Grid Metrics: Describing Data Center Power Effi ciencyâ to refi ne the nomenclature and intent of that paper. In that paper, The Green Grid proposed the use of Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and its reciprocal, Datacenter Effi ciency (DCE) metrics, which enable datacenter operators to quickly estimate the energy effi ciency of their datacenters, compare the results against other datacenters, and determine if any energy effi ciency improvements need to be made. Since then PUE has received broad adoption in the industry but DCE has had limited success due to the misconception of what data center effi ciency really means. As a result, this paper re-affi rms the use of PUE but redefi nes its reciprocal as datacenter infrastructure effi ciency (DCiE). This refi nement will avoid much of the confusion around DCE and will now be called DCiE. In the long term, The Green Grid is developing metrics to measure data center productivity as well as effi ciency metrics for all major power-consuming subsystems in the datacenter. To promote these metrics and drive greater datacenter energy effi ciency for businesses around the world, The Green Grid will publish future white papers that provide detailed guidance on using these metrics. We will also continue to collaborate with organizations such as the EPA, ECMA and Climate Savers that promote a similar goal and vision.},

abstract = {Bilevel optimization problems involve two optimization tasks (upper and lower level), in which every feasible upper level solution must correspond to an optimal solution to a lower level optimization problem. These problems commonly appear in many practical problem solving tasks including optimal control, process optimization, game-playing strategy developments, transportation problems, and others. However, they are commonly converted into a single level optimization problem by using an approximate solution procedure to replace the lower level optimization task. Although there exist a number of theoretical, numerical, and evolutionary optimization studies involving single-objective bilevel programming problems, not many studies look at the context of multiple conflicting objectives in each level of a bilevel programming problem. In this paper, we address certain intricate issues related to solving multi-objective bilevel programming problems, present challenging test problems, and propose a viable and hybrid evolutionary-cum-local-search based algorithm as a solution methodology. The hybrid approach performs better than a number of existing methodologies and scales well up to 40-variable difficult test problems used in this study. The population sizing and termination criteria are made self-adaptive, so that no additional parameters need to be supplied by the user. The study indicates a clear niche of evolutionary algorithms in solving such difficult problems of practical importance compared to their usual solution by a computationally expensive nested procedure. The study opens up many issues related to multi-objective bilevel programming and hopefully this study will motivate EMO and other researchers to pay more attention to this important and difficult problem solving activity.},

abstract = {With the significant advances in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) over the last half century, there is an increasingly perceived vision that computing will one day be the 5th utility (after water, electricity, gas, and telephony). This computing utility, like all other four existing utilities, will provide the basic level of computing service that is considered essential to meet the everyday needs of the general community. To deliver this vision, a number of computing paradigms have been proposed, of which the latest one is known as Cloud computing. Hence, in this paper, we define Cloud computing and provide the architecture for creating Clouds with market-oriented resource allocation by leveraging technologies such as Virtual Machines (VMs). We also provide insights on market-based resource management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational risk management to sustain Service Level Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation. In addition, we reveal our early thoughts on interconnecting Clouds for dynamically creating global Cloud exchanges and markets. Then, we present some representative Cloud platforms, especially those developed in industries, along with our current work towards realizing market-oriented resource allocation of Clouds as realized in Aneka enterprise Cloud technology. Furthermore, we highlight the difference between High Performance Computing (HPC) workload and Internet-based services workload. We also describe a meta-negotiation infrastructure to establish global Cloud exchanges and markets, and illustrate a case study of harnessing 'Storage Clouds' for high performance content delivery. Finally, we conclude with the need for convergence of competing IT paradigms to deliver our 21st century vision.},

abstract = {A scheduling policy strongly influences the performance of a manufacturing system. However, the design of an effective scheduling policy is complicated and time-consuming due to the complexity of each scheduling decision as well as the interactions among these decisions. This paper develops four new multi-objective genetic programming based hyper-heuristic (MO-GPHH) methods for automatic design of scheduling policies including dispatching rules and due-date assignment rules in job shop environments. Besides using three existing search strategies NSGA-II, SPEA2 and HaD-MOEA to develop new MO-GPHH methods, a new approach called Diversified Multi-Objective Cooperative Coevolution (DMOCC) is also proposed. The novelty of these MO-GPHH methods is that they are able to handle multiple scheduling decisions simultaneously. The experimental results show that the evolved Pareto fronts represent effective scheduling policies that can dominate scheduling policies from combinations of existing dispatching rules with dynamic/regression-based duedate assignment rules. The evolved scheduling policies also show dominating performance on unseen simulation scenarios with different shop settings. In addition, the uniformity of the scheduling policies obtained from the proposed method of DMOCC is better than those evolved by other evolutionary approaches.},

abstract = {Virtualization is a vital technology of cloud computing which enables the partition of a physical host into several Virtual Machines (VMs). The number of active hosts can be reduced according to the resources requirements using live migration in order to minimize the power consumption in this technology. However, the Service Level Agreement (SLA) is essential for maintaining reliable quality of service between data centers and their users in the cloud environment. Therefore, reduction of the SLA violation level and power costs are considered as two objectives in this paper. We present a CPU usage prediction method based on the linear regression technique. The proposed approach approximates the short-time future CPU utilization based on the history of usage in each host. It is employed in the live migration process to predict over-loaded and under-loaded hosts. When a host becomes over-loaded, some VMs migrate to other hosts to avoid SLA violation. Moreover, first all VMs migrate from a host while it becomes under-loaded. Then, the host switches to the sleep mode for reducing power consumption. Experimental results on the real workload traces from more than a thousand Planet Lab VMs show that the proposed technique can significantly reduce the energy consumption and SLA violation rates.},

abstract = {Virtualization is a hot topic in operating systems these days. It is useful in many scenarios: server consolida- tion, virtual test environments, and for Linux enthusiasts who still can not decide which distribution is best. Re- cently, hardware vendors of commodity x86 processors have added virtualization extensions to the instruction set that can be utilized to write relatively simple virtual machine monitors. The Kernel-based Virtual Machine, or kvm, is a new Linux subsystem which leverages these virtualization extensions to add a virtual machine monitor (or hyper- visor) capability to Linux. Using kvm, one can create and run multiple virtual machines. These virtual ma- chines appear as normal Linux processes and integrate seamlessly with the rest of the system.},

ARTIS is a general framework for a distributed adaptive system and could, in principle, be applied to many domains. In this paper, ARTIS is applied to computer security in the form of a network intrusion detection system called LISYS. LISYS is described and shown to be effective at detecting intrusions, while maintaining low false positive rates. Finally, similarities and differences between ARTIS and Holland's classifier systems are discussed.},

abstract = {Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have received a great deal of attention regarding their potential as optimization techniques for complex functions. The level of interest and success in this area has led to a number of improvements to GA-based function optimizers and a good deal of progress in characterizing the kinds of functions that are easy/hard for GAs to optimize. With all this activity, there has been a natural tendency to equate GAs with function optimization. However, the motivating context of Holland's initial GA work was the design and implementation of robust adaptive systems. In this paper we argue that a proper understanding of GAs in this broader adaptive systems context is a necessary prerequisite for understanding their potential application to any problem domain. We then use these insights to better understand the strengths and limitations of GAs as function optimizers.},

First a single deterministic heuristic was evolved that minimised the total number of bins used when applied to a set of 685 training instances. Following this, a set of heuristics were evolved using a form of cooperative co-evolution that collectively minimise the number of bins used across the same set of problems. Results on an unseen test set comprising a further 685 problem instances show that the single evolved heuristic outperforms existing deterministic heuristics described in the literature. The collection of heuristics evolved by cooperative co-evolution outperforms any of the single heuristics, including the newly generated ones.},

Cloud computing is defined as a large scale distributed computing paradigm that is driven by economics of scale in which a pool of abstracted virtualized energetically. The number of users in cloud computing is growing exponentially. Large number of user requests tries to designate the resources for many applications which along with to high load not far afield off from cloud server.  Whenever certain VMs are overloaded then no more tasks should be send to overloaded virtual machine if under loaded virtual machines are available. For optimize solution and better response time the load has to be balanced among overloaded and under loaded virtual machines. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed named honey bee behavior based load balancing (HBB-LB), which targets to achieve well balanced load across virtual machine. The experimental results show that the algorithm has many advantages over existing algorithms. There is improvement in average execution time and reduction in waiting time of tasks. The paper also describes briefly about other existing load balancing approaches.},
